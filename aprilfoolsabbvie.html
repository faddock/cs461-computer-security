            <div class="article-content">
                <p><strong>CHICAGO</strong> — In what experts are calling "the most unbelievable cyber attack in human history," pharmaceutical giant AbbVie has reportedly suffered a catastrophic security breach that has taken down all 12,458 of their servers simultaneously across 37 countries.</p>

                <p>According to sources who wished to remain anonymous because they definitely exist, the attack occurred at precisely 3:14 AM this morning when all AbbVie employees simultaneously received emails containing what appeared to be pictures of cute kittens but were actually sophisticated quantum-encrypted malware that "bypassed every known security protocol on Earth."</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>BREAKING DETAILS:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>8.7 PETABYTES of sensitive data allegedly exposed</li>
                        <li>All 127,400 clinical trial records potentially compromised</li>
                        <li>Personal information of 14 million patients may have been accessed</li>
                        <li>Company coffee machines also reportedly hacked, dispensing only decaf</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The hacker group, calling themselves "The Friendly Organizers," claimed responsibility via a message posted on AbbVie's website, which was temporarily replaced with a rotating 3D animation of a smiling cartoon pill wearing a top hat.</p>

                <p>"This is beyond catastrophic," said completely real cybersecurity expert Dr. Max Secure, Director of the Center for Making Up Impressive-Sounding Security Institutes. "We're talking about an attack so sophisticated it could only have been perpetrated by either a nation-state, super-intelligent aliens, or a particularly tech-savvy golden retriever."</p>

                <div class="quotes">
                    "I've never seen anything like it. The attackers didn't just steal the data—they reorganized all of it into neatly labeled folders with color-coded categories and helpful README files. It's horrifying how considerate they were," said AbbVie's fictional Chief Information Security Officer, Sarah Firewall.
                </div>

                <p>In an unprecedented twist, the hackers appear to have not only stolen the data but actually improved its organization. According to the ransom note, which was delivered in the form of a professionally designed PowerPoint presentation complete with transition animations:</p>

                <p>"We have taken all your messy data and reorganized it into a proper directory structure with consistent naming conventions. All duplicate files have been merged, corrupt data has been repaired, and we've added helpful tags to make everything searchable. You're welcome."</p>

                <p>The hackers are demanding what they call a "reverse ransom" — asking AbbVie to donate $10 million to children's hospitals or else they will "continue to help organize more of your systems."</p>

                <p>AbbVie spokesperson Tom Madeupson initially declined to comment, but then couldn't resist mentioning that "honestly, our filing system has never been better. We can actually find things now."</p>

                <p>The FBI has assembled a special task force to investigate the breach, though early reports suggest several agents have already requested the hackers' contact information to help with their own personal digital organization.</p>

                <p>The stock market reacted to the news by briefly panicking before investors realized that having organized data might actually be a good thing, at which point AbbVie's stock inexplicably rose 28%.</p>

                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h3>Expert Analysis</h3>
                    <p>We asked completely fictional cybersecurity expert Professor Hackerman what makes this attack unique:</p>
                    <p>"In my 40 years of pretending to understand cybersecurity for news articles, I've never seen attackers who were so helpful. They even left little digital sticky notes with suggestions for improving network security and included a list of the top 10 strongest passwords they recommend. It's frankly embarrassing how much better they are at IT than most corporations."</p>
                </div>

                <p>At press time, several other pharmaceutical companies were reportedly leaving their server doors unlocked in hopes of receiving similar organizational services.</p>
